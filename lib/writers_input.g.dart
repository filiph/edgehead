The orc with the sword makes three fast leaps toward you, and swings his weapon. You have no time to react, and the blade slits your throat. You gurgle and your arms flail in surprise.


You look at Briana. As the battle axe cleaves her stomach, the two of you hold eye contact.

Soon, the last place in the room that hasn\'t been searched by either you or Briana is the large pile of rotting corpses. Mostly orcs, but there are also some human slaves, and many rats and bats.

After what feels like hours, you get to the bottom. Among a slush of decayed meat, you feel something hard and cold. You pull it from the pile and hold it in the air: the brightest, sharpest sword you have ever seen.

        '''You move into the shadows and wait. After a few heartbeats, there is a scraping sound — stone against stone. You lean out from your hiding place and see a section of the wall to the right of the altar opening.


An orc priest, tall and pale, enters through the stone door. Suddenly, the whole temple reverberates with a strong, dissonant tone that is both sickening and powerful. As if the whole mountain were groaning. 


Following the orc priest, a huge creature enters through the door, crouching below its frame. It\'s unclear what the creature is, exactly, but it could be some large breed of ogre. Judging by the braided hair, it\'s a female. Her sword — attached to her hip with a rope — is as long as you are tall. 


When she enters the temple and stands upright, you can see that she is leading someone in by a chain. An orc. Despite being a strong one, probably a captain or even a chieftain, he is dwarfed by the creature before him, and he visibly shakes in horror.


The three of them — the priest, the ogre and the orc — walk to the front of the altar and stand before it, facing the symbol of the octopus, their backs facing you and Briana.


The dissonant tone stops. You lean a little further out from your hiding place to have a better view.


Without words, the priest beckons the orc to lie at the altar. The orc is now shaking uncontrollably, but he obeys. You can hear his fitful breath, the rustle of his body against the stone as he glides into position, and nothing else.


When the orc lies on the altar, the female ogre walks up to him and places her hands on his shoulders, pinning him down.


Somehow, you know.


_"Maggots."_


Briana gives you a puzzled look, then turns back to the ritual. From the shadows in the base of the altar, a swarm of large black insects starts to make its way up toward the terrified orc. The priest lifts his arms in silent worship.


![Picture of the sadistic slavers](img/altar.jpg)


The ogre pushes down on the orc, preparing for the inevitable struggle. The orc knows what’s coming, and he opens his mouth to scream.


But the scream doesn\'t come. Instead, the dissonant tone sounds again, more powerful than before.


The maggots crawl over the edge of the altar\'s surface, onto the orc\'s body, and move straight toward his face. They move faster now.




The orc\'s eyes go wide. He struggles against the ogre\'s grip, to no avail. The dissonant tone gets even louder. The whole temple quivers. You feel like your ear drums will collapse. The sound permeates everything.


Suddenly, the terror of the moment is fully replaced by an invigorating feeling of power. You take a breath and feel stronger, refreshed.


<p class="toast">Your stamina increases by 1.</p>


You notice that the priest inhales deeply as well.


Then, the sound stops and the orc\'s body collapses into itself. The invigorating feeling is gone. You realize the maggots have eaten through the orc\'s eyes and cheeks, and that they are now scuttling back to the base of the altar.


The priest puts his arms down again and — without saying anything — heads back to the stone door. The ogre takes the orc\'s dead body, throws it over her shoulder, and follows the priest. In a few heartbeats, they are all gone and the door closes. A new pool of blood on the altar is the only reminder of what happened.


Briana stares ahead. "How did you know it would be maggots?"


_"I do not know."_


"I _felt_ that sound, somehow. I _felt_ it."


_"This place does something weird to people."_


"And if that orc was meant to be an offering, why did they not leave the body?" Briana shakes her head. "Let\'s… let\'s just get out of here."

You lean forward to get a little closer to the ogre and withdraw the spear.


Briana gives you a puzzled look. "Wait…" she whispers.


You throw.


The spear sails over the molten steel and impales the blind ogre\'s shoulder. Your heart skips a beat. It wasn’t a killing throw. The ogre will scream, the orcs will hear it — you\'re dead.


But the gods show mercy. The ogre wheels around, trying to reach the spear with his left hand, stepping back.


The last step takes him over the edge and into the pool of white-hot steel. He doesn\'t even have a chance to scream — the liquid swallows him whole. The orcs working on the other side of the room don\'t notice a thing.


"Why would you do that?" Briana says, pointing where the blind ogre once stood. "You wasted a perfectly good spear on a stupid ogre. And he posed no threat to us."


_"Listen."_


The distant voices coming from the war forges get slightly louder. Then louder again. Briana hears it. She looks at you and a smile starts to form on her lips. "Let\'s go," she says.


You follow the short passage and crouch on the walkway above the war forges. You see chaos below: Most orcs and ogres have stopped working and watch molten steel overflowing the troughs and raining down on the forges. A large part of the iron monster is obliterated and the orcs working there are either dead or running away.


You notice an orc using a rope ladder to scale the wall to the smelter. He\'ll be able to get to the gate and close it, but it will take him some time to make the climb. And the damage has already been done.


"That, my friend, was the most boring heroic deed in history." Briana seems amused, watching the havoc below. "You just threw a spear…"


_"A well placed throw."_


"... and killed a _blind_ ogre …"


_"One who was doing an important job."_

The tunnel gets wider and more torches light your way. The walls are smoother. 


You hear heavy breathing and rustling up ahead, and you stop in your tracks, next to a small reinforced door.


A human slave runs down the passage toward you. His arm is visibly broken just above the elbow and blood is streaming down his limping left leg. His lips move but he makes no sound. Eyes blurred with tears, he doesn\'t see you.


Before you can so much as call to him, something long and sharp shoots from behind the slave. A bloodied spearhead appears in the center of the man\'s chest, as if it grew from his body. His tearful eyes glance at the fatal wound. Two more steps toward you and the slave falls face down, the shaft of the spear protruding from his back.


An orc and a goblin appear from the tunnel, walking toward the dead man. The orc is laughing, patting his companion on the back. "Vicious throw, small one!" he roars.


You step back and motion to Briana to lean against the wall, hoping that the door\'s reinforced frame will keep you hidden from the two slavers.


But right then, something or someone pounds on the reinforced door from the inside. You hear loud and angry growls.


The two slavers are now looking directly at you. The goblin yanks his spear from the corpse, and the orc unsheathes his sword. They run toward you.

Briana shakes her head: "The orcs are working together with ogres." A smirk forms on her lips. "They must be terrified."


You scan the workers more closely. The slow-moving ogres tower over the orcs. 


_"And they don\'t use slaves here. They must be doing something important."_


Looking again at the molds they are using, you don\'t see anything strange or unexpected. Primitive axes and swords, some armor.


"What is that thing!" Briana gasps. 


You follow her stare and at first all you see is just a cluster of slightly larger forges. Then you squint and an image appears. It’s an enormous, repulsive, half-assembled insect. Each leg reaches as far as you could throw a rock. And there are eight of them. Then there\'s the body — a huge cockroach-like contraption forged from steel. The teeth are already completed, sharp and menacing, and as long as a man is tall. 


A full-sized ogre pours water over one section of the creature, making a thick cloud of steam. You can\'t see much else. From the high opening in the smelter wall, molten steel is starting to flow down to fill another part of the iron monster.
