You run through a small stone doorway and out of the mountain.


The blinding sun makes you squint. You let the wind chill your muscles and jump down a steep descending path. 


Outside, you and Briana have the upper hand. The orcs and goblins are used to the dark, dank caves, and they come out only when they must. 


Soon, the orcs and goblins stop following altogether, presumably leaving the two of you to their aboveground brothers. 


You look around for a safe route. At first, you cannot make much sense of what you see — this is nothing like the country you left three years ago. Black smoke rises from orc camps and razed villages. You look out over the burned forests and notice the cracks in the wall of the distant Fort Ironcast, just visible over the Glenview Hill. You see no birds, only some horrible dark eagle-like creatures that have no heads circling in both directions above Mount Bloodrock.


![View of the road ahead](img/path.jpg)


Briana doesn\'t seem surprised.


_"We have to stop this."_


Briana follows your gaze, then shakes her head. "This is bigger than us, Aren. This is a problem for kings, not peasants."

"So the thing you have that kings don\'t is… a way to communicate? Or negotiate with him?"


_"Negotiate? No, I do not have anything the Dead Prince wants. I do not think any mortal man does. But I think I am starting to understand what that is, and how the Dead Prince wants to seize it."_


"So what’s the plan?"


_"Giving him the exact opposite of what he wants."_


"You know we could just run, slay some orcs along the way, and get as far away from this place as possible, right?"


_"Yes."_


"Anyone else would do exactly that."


_"But we will not."_


Briana sighs. "No, I suppose we won\'t."


With that, you both start down the road toward the black fort in the distance.

You hear heavy breathing and rustling up ahead, and you stop in your tracks, next to a small reinforced door.

Before you can so much as call to him, something long and sharp shoots from behind the slave. A bloodied spearhead appears in the center of the man\'s chest, as if it grew from his body. His tearful eyes glance at the fatal wound. Two more steps toward you and the slave falls face down, the shaft of the spear protruding from his back.


An orc and a goblin appear from the tunnel, walking toward the dead man. The orc is laughing, patting his companion on the back. "Vicious throw, small one!" he roars.


You step back and motion to Briana to lean against the wall, hoping that the door\'s reinforced frame will keep you hidden from the two slavers.


But right then, something or someone pounds on the reinforced door from the inside. You hear loud and angry growls.


The two slavers are now looking directly at you. The goblin yanks his spear from the corpse, and the orc unsheathes his sword. They run toward you.

Soon, the last place in the room that hasn\'t been searched by either you or Briana is the large pile of rotting corpses. Mostly orcs, but there are also some human slaves, and many rats and bats.

You lean forward to get a little  closer to the ogre and withdraw the spear. 


Briana gives you a puzzled look. "Wait…" she whispers.


You throw.


The spear sails over the molten steel and impales the blind ogre\'s shoulder. Your heart skips a beat. It wasn’t a killing throw. The ogre will scream, the orcs will hear it — you\'re dead. 


But the gods show mercy. The ogre wheels around, trying to reach the spear with his left hand, stepping back.


The last step takes him over the edge and into the pool of white-hot steel. He doesn\'t even have a chance to scream — the liquid swallows him whole. The orcs working on the other side of the room don\'t notice a thing.


"Why would you do that?" Briana says, pointing where the blind ogre once stood. "You wasted a perfectly good spear on a stupid ogre. And he posed no threat to us."

You notice an orc using a rope ladder to scale the wall to the smelter. He\'ll be able to get to the gate and close it, but it will take him some time to make the climb. And the damage has already been done.


"That, my friend, was the most boring heroic deed in history." Briana seems amused, watching the havoc below. "You just threw a spear…"

An orc priest, tall and pale, enters through the stone door. Suddenly, the whole temple reverberates with a strong, dissonant tone that is both sickening and powerful. As if the whole mountain were groaning. 


Following the orc priest, a huge creature enters through the door, crouching below its frame. It\'s unclear what the creature is, exactly, but it could be some large breed of ogre. Judging by the braided hair, it\'s a female. Her sword — attached to her hip with a rope — is as long as you are tall. 


When she enters the temple and stands upright, you can see that she is leading someone in by a chain. An orc. Despite being a strong one, probably a captain or even a chieftain, he is dwarfed by the creature before him, and he visibly shakes in horror.


The three of them — the priest, the ogre and the orc — walk to the front of the altar and stand before it, facing the symbol of the octopus, their backs facing you and Briana. 


The dissonant tone stops. You lean a little further out from your hiding place to have a better view.


Without words, the priest beckons the orc to lie at the altar. The orc is now shaking uncontrollably, but he obeys. You can hear his fitful breath, the rustle of his body against the stone as he glides into position, and nothing else.


When the orc lies on the altar, the female ogre walks up to him and places her hands on his shoulders, pinning him down.


_"Maggots."_


Somehow, you know. 


Briana gives you a puzzled look, then turns back to the ritual. From the shadows in the base of the altar, a swarm of large black insects starts to make its way up toward the terrified orc. The priest lifts his arms in silent worship.


![Picture of the sadistic slavers](img/altar.jpg)


The ogre pushes down on the orc, preparing for the inevitable struggle. The orc knows what’s coming, and he opens his mouth to scream.


But the scream doesn\'t come. Instead, the dissonant tone sounds again, more powerful than before.


The maggots crawl over the edge of the altar\'s surface, onto the orc\'s body, and move straight toward his face. They move faster now.




The orc\'s eyes go wide. He struggles against the ogre\'s grip, to no avail. The dissonant tone gets even louder. The whole temple quivers. You feel like your ear drums will collapse. The sound permeates everything.


Suddenly, the terror of the moment is fully replaced by an invigorating feeling of power. You take a breath and feel stronger, refreshed.


<p class="toast">Your stamina increases by 1.</p>


You notice that the priest inhales deeply as well.


Then, the sound stops and the orc\'s body collapses into itself. The invigorating feeling is gone. You realize the maggots have eaten through the orc\'s eyes and cheeks, and that they are now scuttling back to the base of the altar.


The priest puts his arms down again and — without saying anything — heads back to the stone door. The ogre takes the orc\'s dead body, throws it over her shoulder, and follows the priest. In a few heartbeats, they are all gone and the door closes. A new pool of blood on the altar is the only reminder of what happened.


Briana stares ahead. "How did you know it would be maggots?"


_"I do not know."_


"I _felt_ that sound, somehow. I _felt_ it."


_"This place does something weird to people."_


"And if that orc was meant to be an offering, why did they not leave the body?" Briana shakes her head. "Let\'s… let\'s just get out of here."
